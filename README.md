#  Constrained Delaunay Triangulation 

##  1. Overview 

 ![avatar]( ff771924e659474e8a8d59d49d3ee1cb.png) 

   delaunayTriangulation class allows constraints on boundaries in a two-dimensional triangulation. This means that a pair of points in a triangulation can be selected and the edges used to connect those points can be constrained. This can be used as "applying pressure" to draw a boundary between a pair or pairs of points. The following example illustrates the effect of edge constraints on triangulation. The triangulation below is a Delaunay triangulation because it conforms to the empty circumcircle rule.

    Constraints between vertices (V1, V3) have been followed, but the Delaunay rule is invalidated. In addition, the nearest neighbor relationship inherent in Delaunay triangulation is invalidated. This means that if the triangulation contains constraints, the nearestNeighbor search method provided by delaunayTriangulation cannot be supported. 

#  Triangulation of non-convex polygons 

##  1. Overview 

   In a typical application, a triangulation may consist of a large number of points, and there may be relatively few constrained sides in a triangulation. Such triangulation is considered a locally non-Delaunay triangulation, because many triangles in a triangulation may follow the Delaunay rule, but there may be some locally non-compliant triangles. In many applications, local relaxation of the empty circumscribed circle property is not a problem. Constrained triangulation is often used to triangulate non-convex polygons. These constraints establish a correspondence between the polygon side and the triangulated side. Using this relationship, a triangulation representing that region can be extracted. The following example illustrates how to triangulate a non-convex polygon using a constrained delaunayTriangulation.

    This triangulation cannot be used to represent a polygon domain because some triangles straddle boundaries. You need to impose constraints on the edges that are cut by the triangulated edges. Since the requirements for all edges must be met, all edges need to be constrained. The following steps explain how to constrain all edges.

  ```

    The drawing shows that the triangulated sides meet the polygon boundary requirement. But the triangulation fills the recess. A triangulation representing the polygon domain is required in this case. You can extract the triangle from within the polygon using the delaunayTriangulation method isInterior. This method returns a logical array with true and false values indicating whether the triangle is within the bounded geometric domain. The analysis is based on the approximate curve theorem and the boundary is defined by the edge constraint. If the i-th logical flag is true, the i-th triangle in the triangulation is considered to be within the domain, otherwise it is considered to be outside the domain. Now use the isInterior method to calculate and plot a series of triangles in the domain.

#  Function overview 

##  1. Algorithm overview 

   The depth camera can obtain the distance information from the object to the camera, and can calculate the 3D camera coordinates of the pixel according to the distance information to generate a point cloud. The calculation formula is: in the formula, it is the depth value, the unit is meters; it is the scaling multiple of the depth value; it is the pixel coordinate, which is the 3D point cloud coordinate corresponding to the pixel; it is the focal length of the camera, which is the optical center of the camera, which is the so-called internal reference. The pose of the camera is also called the external parameter of the camera, which will change with the camera movement. Knowing the internal parameter can convert the depth image into a point cloud, and knowing the external parameter can splice the point clouds generated by the depth maps measured at different positions of the same object into a complete point cloud of ground objects.

##  1. Overview of the principle 

   Equal spacing thinning algorithm: Set the sampling spacing in the original point cloud data to, first select 1 point at the beginning of the data; then keep 1 point per interval until all points are screened. The advantages of the equal spacing thinning method are simple, fast and efficient, but the disadvantage is that it cannot better retain the micro-terrain features.

#  Function overview 

##  1. Algorithm overview 

 ![avatar]( 7ccfc8c7b03b4b5eb6308fa44782fa58.png) 

   This example shows how forest metrics and attributes of individual trees can be extracted from aerial LiDAR data. Forest research and applications are increasingly making use of LiDAR data obtained from airborne laser scanning systems. Point cloud data from high-density LiDAR can measure not only forest metrics, but also attributes of individual trees. This example uses point cloud data from an LAZ file captured by an airborne LiDAR system as input. In this example, forest metrics are first extracted by classifying point cloud data into ground points and vegetation points, and then individual tree attributes are extracted by splitting vegetation points into individual trees. The following figure outlines the process.  

##  2. Load and visualize data 

   Unzip the forestData.zip to a temporary directory and load the point cloud data from the LAZ file forestData. laz, into the MATLAB ® workspace. The data comes from Open terrain Dataset [1]. The point cloud mainly contains ground points and vegetation points. Use the readPointCloud function of the lasFileReader object to load the point cloud data into the workspace. Use the pcshow function to visualize the point cloud.

##  3. Split and extract ground points and non-ground points 

   Ground segmentation is a preprocessing step that separates vegetation data to extract forest metrics. Use the segmentGroundSMRF function to segment the data loaded from the LAZ file into ground and non-ground points.

  ```  
##  4. Elevation normalization 

   Use elevation normalization to eliminate the effect of terrain on vegetation data. Use points with normalized elevations as inputs to calculate forest metrics and tree attributes. The elevation normalization steps are as follows: 1. Use the groupsummary function to eliminate duplicate points on axes and axes, if any. 2. Use the scatteredInterpolant object to create an interpolation to estimate each ground point in the point cloud data. 3. Subtract the interpolated ground elevation from the original elevation to normalize the elevation of each point.

##  5. Extract forest indicators 

   The forest metrics are extracted from the normalized points using the helperExtractForestMetrics helper function, which is attached to this example as a supporting file. The helper function first divides the point cloud into a grid based on the supplied gridSize and then calculates the forest metrics. The helper function assumes that all points with a normalized height below the cutoff height are ground and the rest are vegetation. Calculate these forest metrics:

##  6. Canopy height model 

   The canopy height model (CHM) is a raster representation of the height of trees, buildings, and other structures above ground topography. Use CHM as input for tree detection and segmentation. Generate CHM from normalized elevation values using the pc2dem function.

##  7. Detect the top of the tree 

   The tree top is detected using the helperDetectTreeTops helper function, which is attached to this example as a support file. The helper function detects the tree top by looking for a local maximum within a variable window size in CHM. For tree top detection, the helper function only considers points with a normalized height greater than minTreeHeight.

##  8. Single tree segmentation 

   Use the helperSegmentTrees helper function, which is attached to this example as a support file, to split individual trees. The helper function utilizes a marker-controlled watershed segmentation to split individual trees. First, the function creates a binary marker image indicating the tree top position with a value of 1. Then, the function filters the CHM complement by a minimum value puzzle to remove the smallest value that is not the top of the tree. Finally, the function performs a watershed segmentation on the filtered CHM complement to split individual trees. After segmentation, the individual tree segments are visualized.

  ```  
##  9. Extract tree attributes 

   Individual tree properties are helperExtractTreeMetrics extracted using the helper function, which is attached to this example as a support file. First, the function identifies points belonging to individual trees from labels. The function then extracts tree properties such as the tree top position along axes and axes, the tree's approximate height, crown diameter, and area. The helper function returns properties as a table, where each row represents the properties of an individual tree.

#  First, the principle of the algorithm 

##  1. Principle analysis of five-point cubic smoothing algorithm 

   The five-point cubic smoothing algorithm belongs to a kind of smoothing filtering algorithm. In the smoothing filtering algorithm, the commonly used ones are: spline difference function smoothing method, average calculation smoothing method and five-point cubic smoothing method. The spline difference function smoothing method adopts the method of spline interpolation to approximate the sampling point to achieve smoothing. The algorithm is flexible and changeable, and the effect is good. However, the calculation process of this method is relatively complicated, and the performance of smoothing amplitude is poor. Although the average calculation smoothing method is relatively simple, the filtering effect is not good. The principle of the five-point cubic smoothing method to achieve smoothing filtering is to use the polynomial least squares method to approximate the sampling point. The algorithm is very simple and the filtering effect is also good. The principle of the five-point cubic smoothing algorithm: Let the experimental data on each isometric node be Set the equidistance between the two nodes as, do the exchange, then the original node is transformed into. The obtained experimental data is fitted with a sub-polynomial, and the fitting polynomial is: Wherein, the undetermined coefficient in equation (1) is determined using the least squares method, let: In order to minimize, it is derived separately and made equal to 0, and a system of equations can be obtained: This equation is called a normal system of equations. When = 2 (that is, 5 nodes), = 3, a normal system of equations will be obtained, which will be solved and carried into (3), and let, the five-point cubic smoothing formula can be obtained as follows: In the formula: the improved value of is. The algorithm requires the number of nodes to be at least 5. When the number of nodes exceeds 5, in order to calculate symmetrically, except for the two ends of the equation (4)~ formula (8), the rest are smoothed by formula (6), which is equivalent to using different cubic least squares polynomials for smoothing calculation on each sub-interval. After the above derivation, it can be concluded that in the case of equidistant nodes, only experimental data are used in the formula of the five-point cubic smoothing algorithm, and it has nothing to do with, and. The characteristics of the five-point cubic smoothing method preserve the characteristics of the original curve well, and at the same time effectively eliminate the existing interference components, which increases the readability compared with the original curve.
