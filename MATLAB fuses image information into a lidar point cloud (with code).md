  ```  
 Using the camera's intrinsic parameter, intrinsics, the information from Image I is fused to the specified point cloud, ptCloudIn.

  ```  
 The camera is used to rigidly transform the lidar, bring the point cloud into the image frame, and then fuse it with the image information. This syntax is used when the point cloud data is not in the camera coordinate system.

  ```  
 Returns a fused point cloud of the same size as the input point cloud. In addition to any combination of the input parameters in the previous syntax, this function uses the specified color non-overlapping color for points outside the camera's field of view.

  ```  
 Returns the color of the point color map of the fused point cloud.

  ```  
 In addition to the output parameters of the previous syntax, a linear index of the points in the fused point cloud in the camera's field of view is returned.
