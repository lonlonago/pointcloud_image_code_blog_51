  ```  
 Returns the points in the region of interest (ROI) in the input point cloud. The points in the specified ROI are obtained using a KD tree-based search algorithm.

  ```  
   Returns the points within the ROI area of the input point cloud. The input point cloud is an organized point cloud generated by a depth camera. The points within the specified ROI are obtained by a fast approximate neighborhood search algorithm. This function utilizes the camera projection matrix cam matrix to understand the relationship between adjacent points, thus speeding up the search. However, the results have lower accuracy compared to the KD tree-based method. 

>  Attention:

This method only supports organized point cloud data generated by RGB-D sensors. estimateCameraMatrix can be used to estimate the camera projection matrix for a given point cloud data.
