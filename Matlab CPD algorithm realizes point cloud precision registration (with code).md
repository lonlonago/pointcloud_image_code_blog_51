#  Function overview 

##  1. Implement the algorithm 

   In the Matlab point cloud toolbox, there is a direct implementation of the CPD algorithm, without the need to write fancy implementation code yourself (it seems like you are more powerful). 

##  2. Main functions

  ```  
   The coherent point drift (CPD) algorithm is used to achieve point cloud registration, and the registered transformation matrix is output.
