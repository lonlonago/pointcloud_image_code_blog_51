  ```  
   Returns the index of the nearest neighbors of the query point in the input point cloud. The point cloud can be either unordered or ordered. The nearest neighbors of the query point are computed by using a Kd tree-based search algorithm.

  ```  
 Returns the first nearest neighbor of a query point in the input point cloud. The input point cloud is an ordered point cloud generated by the depth camera. The K-nearest neighbor of the query point is determined using the fast approximation K-nearest neighbor search algorithm. This function uses the camera projection matrix camMatrix to understand the relationship between neighboring points, thus speeding up the nearest neighbor search. However, the results have lower accuracy compared to the Kd tree-based method.

 In addition to the input parameters in the above syntax, options are specified using one or more name-value parameters. 

 input parameter 

 Name-value corresponding parameter 

   Specify the optional parameter pair as Name1 = Value1,..., NameN = ValueN, where Name is the parameter name and Value is the corresponding value. The name-value argument must appear after the other arguments, but the order of the argument pairs does not matter.
